2. Cat image in front of clipboard (not the one on the clipboard)

## Lights:
1. Yellow spotlights on every objective chip
2. Blue lghts emiting from some of the computer screens
3. Directional lighting for the whole game- green hues to represent office theme

2. Win sound played when all chips have been collected
3. Collision sound when objects are pushed to the ground
4. Background electronic static sounds

All these new elements add to the feeling of the game. It fits into the whole alone in the office atmosphere.
