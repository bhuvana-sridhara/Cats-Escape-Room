Our game is multiplayer, where our game is objective based/Escape. The interaction of our game was cooperative play since players have to work together and find the chips. The overall setting of the game is that you are humans transformed into cats and you must find the CPU chips in order to turn back human! Procedure of the game was WASD to move, Space to jump. The Where of the procedure was inside of the IT Room, the when of the procedure was the 2 minute timer set. We followed the game theme with how CPU's are related to the computer architecture and we also had a 2nd puzzle that made the player think about computer architecture in order to solve (putting the image together). The game is a blast I couldn't stop playing it and I learned so much about computer architecture.
